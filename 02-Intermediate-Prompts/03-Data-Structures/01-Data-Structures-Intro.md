# Introduction

### Section

This section focuses on manipulating arrays, objects, and nested structures. 
######
Many problems deal with navigating complex structures in both the real world and in toy problems. Confidence dealing with large structures without becoming overwhelmed is important, and will up your coding ability.
######
### Learning Objectives  

To help in solving such problems, you will review and practice the following:  
######
* *Ease of navigating arrays and objects*
* *Confidence working with nested data*
* *Comprehension skills when parsing complex information*
* *Identifying relationships between data sets*
* *Working through complex logic*

######
### Constraints
######
The basic section of this course prohibited the use of certain methods. The trend follows in this sections. Specifically, you will not be able to apply `Object` methods to the majority of problems here. 
######
The goal is to build competency with loops and basic javascript logic. Later in your coding career, you can make use of multitude of methods to shorten and clarify your problem solving approach. For now, we strongly discourage the use of `Object.keys`, `Objet.values`, and `Object.entries`.
