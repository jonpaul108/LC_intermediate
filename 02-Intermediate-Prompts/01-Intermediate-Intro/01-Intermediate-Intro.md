# Intro

######
Welcome to the intermediate section of the Laser Coaching Curriculum. Here you will be faced with greater challenges requiring you to implement accurate knowledge of javascript to solve increasingly complex problems. 
######
### Learning Objectives
By practicing the problems in this section, you will gain or review the following:
###### 
* *Deeper understanding of string immutability*
* *Increased awareness of relationships between data*
* *Accurate implementation of Javascript Execution Flow*
* *Capability in parsing long form data*
* *Practice in logic application*
* *Competency in reading other people's code*
* *Further practice with planning and debugging*

## Scope of Sections

Each section connects with the others. The titles are not comprehensive to the content contained within each problem set. For example, 'Data Structures' will have problems that test and require understanding of strings, numbers, etc, not just objects and arrays. 
######
The difficulty generally grows each lesson as the student journeys deeper into the given prompts. By the end of the lessons, the student can expect to face harder questions challenging their problem solving skills.

## How To Study

Any instructions provided by your laser coach trump any instructions written here. *You should follow your coach's directions*. The below are meant as general prescriptions to either remind of or strengthen the advice given by a coach.
######
To benefit most from these prompts, it is important to follow a practice pattern that ensures you will perform well and efficiently under pressure.
######
Here are some recommendations:
######
* *Give yourself time pressure. Set a timer for 20 minutes. Stop when you run out of time.*
* *Give yourself plenty of time to comprehend, understand, and plan for a prompt. 5 - 10 minutes is normal!*
* *Practice the style of explaining you plan on using during the TAA while solving the prompts.*
* *If you did not solve the problem in the time limit, try again from scratch 24-48 hours later.*
* *Review what you did well.* 
* *Reflect on where you might have wasted time.*
* *Reflect on your performance and progress. Consider how to improve.*
* *Take your coach's advice.*


### Time for some problems! Good luck!
