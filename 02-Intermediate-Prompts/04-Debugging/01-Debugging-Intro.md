# Introduction

### Section

The final section of intermediate focuses on debugging provided attempted solutions.
######
Debugging is a core of programming. Whether it is your code, or someone else's, throughout your coding journey you will often be faced with code that does not work as expected.  
Bugs can come in a few forms:
  * Logic errors
  * Syntax errors
  * Run time errors

Problems will mainly contain logic errors, though you may encounter syntax and runtime errors as well. 
######
### Learning Objectives  
*It is your goal to solve the prompts based on the intention of the original coder, not to resolve these prompts from scratch*.  

To help build adequate debugging skills, this section provides challenges for review or practice of the following concepts: 

* *Loop logic*
* *Conditionals in iterations*
* *Var placement and declarations*
* *Return statements*
* *Code investigation*
* *General debugging skills*
######
# How to Practice

This platform is limited in the ability to debug. It is advisable to use a repl or IDE (such as VS code) in your efforts to debug. 
######
When debugging, and the error is not obvious, you should:
* Log
* Read code using example data
* Run test data
* Understand the bug before making changes (i.e. not engaging in "try and see" style of debugging)
######
By implementing the above strategies, you should be able to solve the prompt by:
* Finding and understanding the bug
* Making small changes to fix the issues
* Not deleting and starting over

##### Good Luck!
