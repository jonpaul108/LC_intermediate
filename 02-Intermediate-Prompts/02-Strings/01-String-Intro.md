# Introduction

### Section

This section focuses on string concepts.  
######
Many students obtain significant knowledge and capability on non-scalar data types (arrays / objects) , but struggle with scalar types (strings / numbers / booleans / etc). Strings tend to pose particular difficuly due to being iterable but not mutable.
######
### Learning Objectives  
It is common in both toy problems and the real world to need to parse strings and deal deeply with all data types. 
######
To help in solving such problems, you will review and practice the following concepts:  
######
* *Deep understanding of string immutability*
* *Ease in string index navigation (iterations)*

######
If you are unfamiliar with `string immutability`, it wold be worth your time to look up the concept.

*Not understanding the above listed objectives could impede later progress in this module. It is highly recommended students complete this section before moving to the next.*

######
### Constraints
######
The basic section of this course prohibited the use of certain methods. The trend follows in this sections. Particulary, students will not be able to apply `String.split` to the majority of problems.
